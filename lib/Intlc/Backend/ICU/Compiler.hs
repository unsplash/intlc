-- This module is essentially the inverse of the parsing we perform; it's
-- semantically reversible in that respect if not precisely due to formatting,
-- no preservation of the presence of defaults, etc.
--
-- This is a special backend in that it's not exposed as a "backend" but is
-- instead used post-flattening. Additionally it only operates upon individual
-- ICU messages, offloading JSON handling to the caller.
